# BoardI
I installed virtual studio code and node.js on my pc.
neccessary packages were installed as per requirement.
the json file was created 
I have created two files BI and BI model.
BI contains the taskname, description, creator and duration and created at which are to be entered by the user.
If a particular task is not entered, it will display "No task found".
In BI model, the datatype of all the required inputs has been initialised and duration is calculated after which the program will be re-terminated.
There is a function expiresAt, which terminates the program aftyer the given time duration.
